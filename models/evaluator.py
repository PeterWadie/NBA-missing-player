    Evaluates the trained models on the test data.

    Test data is loaded from TEST_DATA_DIR:
      - NBA_test.csv: Contains test samples with a missing home player (indicated by '?')
      - NBA_test_labels.csv: Contains the removed player's name (column "removed_value")

    For each test sample:
      - The season (year) is identified.
      - For years in TARGET_YEARS (2008-2016), models are loaded from data/<year> directory
        These models are trained on previous year's data. For example, the 2008 model is trained on 2007 data.
      - The four present home players are determined (ignoring the '?' among home_0 to home_4).
      - The candidate pool is built from the home team's roster (all players not in the present four).
      - For each candidate, candidate features are computed (using build_candidate_features) and a feature row is constructed.
      - The candidate sample is encoded with the seasonâ€™s LabelEncoders.
      - The season's XGBoost model is used to predict the probability of the candidate being the correct missing player.
      - The candidate with the highest predicted probability is selected.
      - The prediction is compared to the ground truth from NBA_test_labels.csv.

    Results are aggregated per season and cumulatively, and then saved as evaluation_results.json.
